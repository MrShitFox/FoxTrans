# FoxTrans architecture

FoxTrans follows **functional core, stateful adapters**. Pure or resource-free code
handles VAD state transitions, duration calculations, WAV packing, and OSC packet
formatting. Classes own the stateful edges: microphone callbacks, native WebRTC VAD,
HTTP, UDP, bounded queues, and the console.

`Program.cs` is the explicit composition root. There is no DI container, service
locator, generic pipeline framework, or base provider hierarchy.

The current direct-audio path is:

```text
NAudio microphone -> bounded frame channel -> WebRTC VAD segmenter
                  -> bounded completed-segment channel
                  -> sequential OpenAI-compatible audio translator
                  -> output sinks (currently VRChat OSC)
```

- `IAudioSource` produces typed PCM frames and exposes their format.
- `IAudioSegmenter` turns frames into speech lifecycle updates and completed segments.
- `IAudioTranslator` translates one completed audio segment.
- `IOutputSink` publishes translations and typing changes.
- `IAppReporter` is the only boundary for application diagnostics and UI state.

Both queues are bounded. A full completed-segment queue reports a diagnostic and
waits, applying backpressure instead of dropping a phrase. The microphone callback
cannot wait safely; if its bounded frame queue fills, capture stops with an explicit
overflow error. Audio loss is never silent. HTTP translation runs on a separate
sequential consumer, so it does not pause VAD or clear audio captured meanwhile.

Providers do not access `Console`; `ConsoleUi` owns the dashboard. Shutdown cancels
capture, completes channels, waits for both workers, forces typing off, disposes
native/network resources, and restores console state.

Future sessions can add batch or streaming transcription between segmentation and
translation, replace any adapter behind its existing boundary, and add outputs such
as a VR overlay. Those interfaces are intentionally not introduced before they are
used.

Keep related contracts and small models together in meaningful files; do not create
one file for every small record or interface.
